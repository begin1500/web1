<p>W3C is pleased to announce the report from the W3C Workshop on Smart Cities, held on 25 June 2021.

The main goal of the workshop was to improve and finalize the description of the draft Charter for a potential Smart Cities Interest Group so that we can launch the Interest Group and start further discussions on (1) interoperability for Web-based Smart City services and (2) use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support Smart City services.
